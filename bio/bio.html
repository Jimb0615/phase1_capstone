        <h2> About Me 
        </h2>
        <p>
            Hi, my name is Jim and I have worked in Liberty Investments for 17 years. 
            I started as a desktop engineer supporting the traders and trade operations teams and have since moved into a systems enginering role supporting data center operations and infrastructure hardware, software, data and security. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In my free time I travel the country in my RV which I live in full time. I really enjoy living off grid and have spent a lot of time building out a solar power system to support that.
            I enjoy photography and take pictures everywhere i go. I also enjoy riding my on/off road motorcyle any time i have the chance. 

        </p>
